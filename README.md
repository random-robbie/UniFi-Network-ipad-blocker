# UniFi-Network-ipad-blocker

Script to block childs ipads from the internet using UniFi Network setup.

Made this to set a cron later to block the kids from being on their ipads when they shouldn't be.

Next up will be to intergrate this to alexa skill.

You need to edit the config section and fill in your details and then change childs names and mac addresses!
